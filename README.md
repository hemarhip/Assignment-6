# Assignment 6
# Calculator GUI using Tkinter

This is a simple calculator application built using Python's `tkinter` module. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations through a graphical interface.

# Features
- GUI built with `tkinter`
- Buttons for digits (0â€“9) and basic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Entry widget to show input and results
- Functional buttons for clear (`clear`) and equal (`=`)

# How It Works
- The main window is created using Tk().
- An Entry widget displays the current input or result.
- Each button appends the respective value to the input field using the click() function.
- = evaluates the expression using eval() and displays the result.
- "clear" clears the entry box.
